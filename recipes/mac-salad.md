## Ingredients

-   2-4 lbs of Cauliflower, in 1/2inch x 1/2inch chunks
-   1 medium red onion, minced
-   2 Fresno Peppers, minced
-   2 cups Castelvetrano Olives, pitted and sliced
-   3 cloves garlic (or more, to taste)
-   1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
-   1/4 cup Dijon Mustard with whole seeds
-   1 cup Mayonaise
-   Salt (to taste)
-   Pepper (to taste, but use a lot)

## Instructions

1. Steam Cauliflower until tender, but still has bite. This is by far the hardest part of the recipe, and when in doubt, pull it out EARLY. Too crunchy is better than too mushy.
2. In large colander, drain cauliflower, then rinse with copious cold water. This will help it cool down faster.
3. In large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients together well, starting with the more sauce-like ingredients.

Wait a long while, ideally a day or more, then eat. Enjoy!
